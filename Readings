  <h1>Marxist / Communist / Theoretical Readings</h1>


  <blockquote>Just as Darwin discovered the law of development or organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history: the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology, that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc.; that therefore the production of the immediate material means, and consequently the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch, form the foundation upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, art, and even the ideas on religion, of the people concerned have been evolved, and in the light of which they must, therefore, be explained, instead of vice versa, as had hitherto been the case. <span>(Engels, Speech at the grave of Marx, 1883)</span></blockquote>
  <p>The focus of these readings is <i>criticism</i>, or the benefit and advancement &mdash; but not preparation &mdash; thereof. This optician's shop provides no preparation because no pair of glasses &mdash; no particular reading &mdash; can be correctly seen as the "first" or "last word". Each is, often accidentally, in reference to each other. Each being critical of the current state of affairs, the focus is also <i>Marxist</i>.</p>
  <p>However, Marx doesn't stand at the centre of this collection; nor does he stand with a watchful eye below or within each text, like Hamlet's ghost "crying under the stage". The presence of Marxism within each text is provided merely by the context within which it is placed here; that is to say, each text reminds each other text of their tradition, shaking a memory back into the forefront of the mind. This is not the only <i>awakening</i> within these texts; the other is the rude awakening that they bring to capital: in a critical text, capital is shunned from its position as the ghost beneath the stage, and suddenly becomes the protagonist of the play who, after a proud rise to power, faces its own hamartia.</p>
  <blockquote>Capital is an abstract parasite, an insatiable vampire and zombiemaker; but the living flesh it converts into dead labor is ours, and the zombies it makes are us. <span>(Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism, 2009)</span></blockquote>
  <p>A text has no duty; it is simply put before the reader who then must provide themselves with some kind of duty: read the entire text slowly, without consciously reading your own presuppositions into it, but instead allowing your prior knowledge to serve as a foundation on which the text can build.</p>
  <p>The division of "theory and praxis" is untenable; each contains the other as an essential moment. For as long as theory avoids organised totalisation, it <i>is</i> practice. It is, hopefully, the practice that will make practice unnecessary.</p> -->
  <blockquote>In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic. <span>(Marx, German Ideology, 1845)</span></blockquote>
